Discord Bot to Perform Style Transfer on Custom Images

## How to run
To start this bot on a local server, do the following:
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Make sure you have installed Discord.js through `npm install discord.js`
3. Run `npm install request` to be able to download images
4. Create your config.json file
5. Make sure your bot is in the server (and invite if they aren't in already)
6. Open a terminal and run `node index.js`
7. Now you should be able to use the bot in your server. Enjoy!

*Note*: We will make these instructions nicer and more clear later...
