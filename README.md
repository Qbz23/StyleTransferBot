## How to run
To start this bot on a local server, do the following:
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Make sure you have installed Discord.js through `npm install discord.js`
3. Create your config.json file
4. Make sure your bot is in the server (and invite if they aren't in already)
5. Open a terminal and run `node index.js`
6. Now you should be able to use the bot in your server. Enjoy!
