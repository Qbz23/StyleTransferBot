## How to Use (in Discord)

To use the bot, first mention the bot however it is called in your server (default @styletransfer) and then type a sentence describing what you would like. Please order your sentence such that the object/subject of interest comes first, and the style comes later. Both the object/subject and style should be in parenthesis.

Examples:
- `@styletransferbot please paint me some "maple leaves" in the style of "starry night"`
- `@styletransferbot "cat" "gustav klimt"`
- `@styletransferbot I would like "toast and eggs" to look like "yoshitaka amano"`
